Confit croquants were dry and had the weirdest ingredients that would have masked any subtle duck flavors(horseradish like flavor for one). Tartar could have been more nicely balanced with salt, mush less basil and with something other than partially soggy plantain chips...and that was the my favorite. Why would a french restaurant take it upon themselves to change a classic tartar recipe, which works, to an Italian failure with basil and parmigiano? The lamb dish was where it fell flat, they marinated the shank and then cooked it for 6 hours? It was hard to tell this was lamb vs dry stew beef. The plate was ugly and quite small, french is supposed to be complex yet simple in the preparation used. Getting the most out of the technique vs the amount of ingredients, these guys seem to be serving up poor contemporary American with a french wine list.

Forced ourselves to eat it because we were starving. The scallops were way over powered by salt less slaw of apples, cabbage, citrus, and tomatoes! Yes tomatoes! C'mon....no respectable menu has tomatoes right now. And garnished with so much oil that I was kinda grossed out by my slippery greasy lips afterwards. Not to mention the over powering flavor of raw shallot or onion. Idk which it was because I couldn't actually see it. It just didn't work. Sorry. Pork n beans- that was ok. I give it a 61/2. Could've gotten more if it wasn't cold. And lastly- the tartar. Slightly underseasoned and almost half of my fingerling chips stuck together making them soggy/chewy/leathery chips. We didn't even finish it. Server asked how it was and I said it was just ok with a disappointed face. Not worth going Into detail because they probably thought we were just picky eaters and not actual SF chefs (which we are). O well.

The service was excruciatingly slow, it was ten minutes before we were even brought water. My boyfriend asked at the beginning of the meal for a cup of ice, which never came. And every request afterwards took at least ten minutes and multiple reiteration to be fulfilled. In addition to his slow pace, Alex also had a terrible attitude. He didn't smile, or make us feel welcome during any part of the meal, and his gruff conduct with service and refilling made us fully aware that he didn't want us to be there. He never checked up on us to see how we liked the food, and any comment of praise to the restaurant fell on deaf ears. When we ordered dessert (we were not offered), he made no attempt to offer coffee, or wine. In fact, the only part of the service that actually occurred quickly was the payment of the tab and placement of the receipt; which after the service, felt entirely overpriced as not worth it.

The sommelier recommend a nice pinot noir, and didn't annoyingly point to the most expensive bottle, which I appreciated. I had the braised pork shoulder, and it was perfect. For dessert, I had the creme fraiche custard, and it was intensely sweet, but still good overall.", "review_business_rating": 4.5, "review_business_reviews_count": 461.0, "review_business_name": "Bouche"}

The food felt like such a brick I could barely get down a glass of wine with it. 4 hours later I still felt disgusting for having ate even a portion of it (I didn't get even close to finishing either of my dishes).

The golden osetra caviar with potato pancake and lobster was a fantastic start as it was buttery and smooth. Since the foie gras is now back in the market here I tried the foie gras soup that had a foamy texture and seared foie gras with truffled vinegarette. Both proved to be a good choice for an appetizer. We also had some compliments of the chef items such as the house cured salmon lollipop, uni in an eggshell and hamachi with trout roe. For the main entree I tried the roti squab and quail and the seared duck breast. For dessert, the souffl and baked Alaska was a sweet ending to our evening.

The Musque de Provence Soup with 5 Spice Marshmallow, Micro Celery, Toasted, and Pumpkin Seeds was very good. Musquee is a French squash. The soup was prepared without cream. The Sauted Burgundy Snails in Pernod Lemon Butter, Parsley, Bone Marrow Gratin were the best snails I have ever had. They were prepared uniquely and placed in bone marrow. Luscious. The Black Cod, Sunchoke Puree, Roasted Salsify,Butternut Squash, Caper Brown Butter Sauce Huckleberry and Lemon was sublimely delicious. There are treats without dessert. This dinner was $95. With wine pairing, I believe another $65 pp. There is a tasting menu of several courses also.

We made reservations online and wrote that there was a birthday. When I walked in, this Asian lady walked towards me mumbling something and I kind of moved out of the way because I thought she was trying to get out. It turns out that she was the hostess. The reason I thought she was a customer was because she was so poorly dressed. She was wearing this heather gray sweater, a pair of jeans, and black slippers with white socks. The outfit seriously looked like it was purchased at Walmart and I'm honestly not saying this to be funny. She also had no make-up on, her hair was a mess and she didn't even bother smiling. The only way that I can explain how this tore up looking woman is the hostess is that she must be the chef/owner's wife because I seriously doubt anyone else would get away looking like that. Everyone else, including the bus boys, looked a million times better than this woman. Besides the angry homeless looking hostess, the service was pretty good. Our server, who I swear looked like the hostess's brother, was just OK but the bus boys were on top of everything and there was another guy who immediately took our drink orders even though he wasn't our server. The food, on the other hand, really wasn't that good. The presentation was excellent but the taste did not live up to the hype. The food was just mediocre and most definitely not worth the price. Also, I thought it was in really poor taste that no one acknowledged my mother's birthday. I mean, I'm not looking to get anything free, but whenever we make a reservation and we write that it's someone's birthday, the server always mentions it. A \"oh I heard that it's someones birthday...\" would have been nice. If I bothered mentioning it in the reservation, that should be a sign that I would like this fact to be acknowledged.

We must have been waited on by three servers--I have no idea who our actual waitperson was. Of course, no one introduced themselves, so I really had no clue. I usually don't drink a lot of water when I'm at dinner, but I did this night since it was so warm in the restaurant. There were three times I went to grab my glass of water and it was empty. We spent half the time waiting--waiting to hear specials, waiting to get our first glasses of water, waiting to get wine suggestions, waiting to have our order taken, waiting for the check. I think we could have been in and out of there in half the time. My dish was horrible. I ordered what I was hoping was Chapeau's signature dish--the cassoulet. It came out dry as if it had been sitting under a warming lamp for 30 minutes (which would not have surprised me). As we began to eat, I heard no \"oh-my-gosh, this is great!\" comments nor did I hear any \"mmmms\". For dessert, the blueberry pastry with creme anglaise tasted like Yoplait blueberry yogurt. The warm chocolate dessert was well-received by those in the party who ordered it. Actually that was the first food-related \"ooh-aah\" I heard. The best parts of the dinner were the wine that was eventually recommended to us--a Condreau and the decaf cappuccino. The one nice service touch was that one of the waiters went up to Geary to get us a taxi. He would not take a tip and simply asked us to come back again. I wish I could because of his kindness, but that won't be enough for me to return. This was a special occasion since it was the bachelorette party weekend for a good friend of mine.

When we arrived, at around 5, we were shown to a table that was okay, and told there were no others, despite the fact that there were few diners there. Okay, we accepted that, no worries, those tables may have been reserved ahead too. We then told our waitperson that it was our wedding day and the four of us were celebrating. No enthusiasm, just a \"that's nice,\" which felt a little puncturing, but we went on to order our meals without fanfare. One of our meals was underdone, and the waitperson seemed annoyed to have to do anything about it. We ordered desserts and wines, and spent well over $200----tipping nicely despite. And yet, nothing much about this experience felt very special. Perhaps one has to be young and hip to get special attention here, and we are middle aged. One person in our party is from Montreal, knows fine French dining, and is very open-minded; but he said that I probably should have chosen another place that understands what it means to celebrate a festivity. In reviewing the overall experience, we all agreed that none of us would go back. I did catch a glimpse of the owner coming in to talk to some other tables, and he seems like a very personable man.

We went on a Saturday night and the service was awful from the start. It took 30 minutes before the waitress took our order. The table next to us also had to wait a long time. The New York steak was cold and the butter couldn't even melt it was so cold. The french fries looked and tasted as if they had been reheated several times. The waitress was no where to be found. We finally flagged down the bus boy and told him in Spanish our food was terrible and he replaced it. The second time the food was cooked properly and was Okay, but nothing to write home about. Le Zinc on 24th Street and Chou Chou on Laguna are MUCH better French restaurants. The table next to us waited 45 minutes for their food to come out. When they complained to the waitress she said \"that is the french way\" They were Indian and had specifically asked if the Scallions had bacon. They were told no and the Scallions did have bacon. They were celebrating a birthday dinner and the person paying couldn't eat his dinner. AGAIN, no waitress to tell about the problem. Another table had the waitress spill carmel on her shirt. Finally the waitress came by our table and I was able to tell her about the first steak being terrible and that the busboy had helped us. The table next to us just wanted the bill. They waited another half an hour for the bill. When the waitress came with the bill she said \"I hope you enjoyed your dinner\" and they were finally able to tell her they didn't because the Scallions had bacon. She just smiled and said thanks for telling me. Then she came back and told them they would take the meal off the bill. They had to wait again for another bill. This is the worst place I've ever been to. There are so many French restaurants in the city that I would advice anyone to skip this place and go to either Le Zinc or Chou Chou.

The oysters were fine, then it went downhill from there. The crab was not any kind of crab I am used to, and had a mouth feel more like canned tuna fish, the asparagus was one limp stalk. The bass was mostly skin, although nicely browned and with a generous dollop of fresh herbs, it came across like a miserly portion, despite its presentation.

The place was already full by 6:30 p.m. so we ate at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and helpful. However, the food was not impressive in the least. I ordered the crab asparagus salad and the beet ravioli. The salad came with no asparagus and mushy, fishy tasting crab that was more like canned tuna than anything else. I only had two bites and hungrily looked forward to my main course. When the beet ravioli came, it was missing the parmesan listed on the menu and looked soupy and full of gray vegetables. But I dug in anyway. My first bite of ravioli was, well, odd. It was very doughy and chewy. Another bite, and I thought maybe it was undercooked. By the fourth bite, the raw flour taste came through clearly and I realized they were indeed raw. Maybe they thought the hot broth would cook the ravioli, but it didn't. I gave it back and they offered me a free dessert. The cheese platter I received was fantastic, thank goodness. So I filled up on bread and cheese. My husband ordered the neighborhood menu and his food was fine. He got the mozzarella and tomato salad, the pork chop and the creme caramel. They were all fine, but nothing to get excited about.

We took a large table at the back and took about five minutes scrounging for a few extra chairs. Once we were settled a server approached us and we tried to order some drinks.

Friends had highly touted this restaurant and insisted we go there on a recent business trip to SF, overriding my desire to try Cafe des Amis down the street. Based on my (our) experience, I am trying to figure out all the rave reviews that exist for this place. Sure, the staff (including the owner) are friendly, but who cares when their incompetence level is so high? Being greeted at the door, which took a long while to be noticed, with \"Bonjour!\" at 9 PM should have tipped me off that this is not a real French bistro. The cons: limited menu, very average wine list, three pasta dishes are inexplicably the only things listed under the \"Pate\" heading on the menu (WTF?), attempting to get a glass of wine or anything else requires a lot of arm waving or shouting \"SIR, CAN WE GET YOUR ATTENTION FOR A MOMENT?\" which isn;t justified in such a tiny restaurant, And then of course, is the food itself, which proved almost inedible to me. I started with the \"Steak Tartare\", a bizarre interpretation that was watery and so laden with spicy horseradish (or was it mustard?) it had me running for the Zantac almost immediately - zero flavor to the beef, only the heat from the horseradish. What happened to the traditional capers, parsley, and shallots used with prudence? To it's credit, it did come topped with a small raw quail egg. Then the second courses, First, the escargot, which consisted of six tiny morsels - tender enough, but sitting in a very spicy butter which must have been doused with tablespoons of white or cayenne pepper and adding more heartburn to my already churning stomach. Perhaps the \"French\" chefs visible in the kitchen, (Ramon, Juan, and Jorge?) were trying to impart some good ol' south-of-the border heat into classic bistro fare? The other dish, the arugula and goat cheese salad was flavorful enough but there was far too much arugula itself, and it was compressed into a cake-like mass complete with a myriad of tough stems. My friends both had one of the three mussel dishes offered, and seemed to be fine with their choices, although the owner suggested an overbearing California cabernet sauvignon to go with the mussels - a truly incomprehensible suggestion.

My husband and I went there to celebrate our first anniversary. The place has undergone some unfortunate changes since our visit last year. We were seated at a table for two next to the balustrade circling the second floor. Gone are the elegant white tablecloths on the tables in this area, in a failed attempt to \"urbanize\" the restaurant with ugly battleship gray steel tabletops (very cold visually, noise producing, and to the touch uninviting). What you might expect if dining at The Counter for a burger. Our server was pleasant but not articulate, and very rarely available during our meal. We ordered the crispy oysters as the appetizer -- they arrived looking like 6 tiny charred pebbles, tasteless and awful. (Our complaint about them did at least get them removed from our tab.) However, the glasses of chardonnay we ordered to have accompanied the oysters did not arrive until we had to remind (a very harried sommelier as our server was nowhere to be found), and arrived long after the oysters had gone cold. It took more than 30 mins. for our respective entrees to arrive, and the bottle of pinot noir we ordered to accompany also arrived late, again, with my husband having to track down the sommelier to get it for us. The server who delivered our entrees (not the original server) was sneezing while putting our dishes on the table, quite a turn-off. My lamb entre was tasty enough, but my husband's duck was mediocre and ill presented. The broccoli dish we ordered at an extra $14 to accompany our entrees arrived undercooked and horribly over-salted, inedible. We decided to make the best of it and order dessert. The server came back to us 20 mins after we ordered dessert to \"confirm\" what we had ordered -- in other words, she had forgotten to place the order. Desserts finally arrived 30 mins later. With all the spare time we had with our food and wine not arriving as they should have, we noticed a number of other restaurant clients complaining, and one gentleman actually got up and became animated with the staff. As we exited the restaurant, another patron was voicing dissatisfaction with the manager on the first floor. What should have been a lovely evening and dining experience turned out to be a very negative and uninspiring experience at a very high price. Needless to say, we will not return, especially with so many excellent dining options in the city which would surely put Jardiniere to shame.", "review_business_rating": 4.0, "review_business_reviews_count": 1289.0, "review_business_name": "Jardinire"}

I think if we mention that there is no need to space out our courses that they should really take that into consideration. There were really long uncomfortable periods in between courses and we were starving. Even something as simple as iced tea took 10 to 15 minutes which is ridiculous. They kept changing our plates repeatedly even though they were still really clean. We told them it was unnecessary and that we should conserve water. Its not like we were eating at a Chinese restaurant and our plates had all kinds of sauces. We literally had minuscule morsels and barely anything on the plate. The pasta was not el dente and we spit it out onto the plate. It seemed like it was blanched and then served to us. I could understand if it came out really fast but it didn't. Each course came out painfully slow. The duck and chicken were really dry, flavor was lacking as well.

Since one of us ordered a prix fixe menu, you would think he could figure it out, but he didn't. Every dish fell far short of acceptable. The corn soup was bland and runny. The scallop salad was too sour and overpowered the mild taste of the scallop. My seafood stew (kind of like a bouliabase) was fishy. The fish was overcooked, not fresh and under-seasoned. My friend's duck confit was under-flavored and dry. In addition, they served it with lentil stew, so the dish was a brown blob that was a one note in terms of flavor and texture. How do you screw up duck cooked in duck fat? Well go to Fringale and find out. Nothing came out hot (like warm at best).

He pointed to me as I walked up and asked whether he should stand up and now sit down again as I was now there. She made some rude comment I could not hear, so I asked her why she was giving us so much attitude. I explained that I was using THEIR ATM and paying THEM $2.50 to get money out of it and what was the problem with him sitting down before me. She said \"I'm French I always have attitude.\" I was shocked. Rather than apologizing for her being rude to him, she explained that's how I should expect to be treated by her. So, I asked again, \"I don't understand. What exactly is the problem and why are you giving us so much attitude.\" She again said, \"I'm French. This is the way I am. Of course, I have attitude.\" Again, completely floored that a hostess at a restaurant would instead of wanting to welcome a paying customer would tell that customer to expect to be treated rudely.

Half an hour later and the food still hasn't arrived. Second warning. Note that we were the first people in the restaurant to place an order. Well, when the food finally arrived, it was half an hour later. Rather than apologize, the guy simply stated \"the first order is always the hard one, I don't know why.\" If he would have added an \"I'm sorry\", it would have gone a long way. And of course, everyone else started getting their food right away. ", "review_business_rating": 4.0, "review_business_reviews_count": 463.0, "review_business_name": "Chez Maman West"}

I know tons of better breakfast places both in and out of the city that cost less. Breakfast with coffee cost me $22 including tax, tip, and health tax. I had one of the breakfast specials today, the Eggs En Fonte (?), which came in a skillet about 4 inches in diameter. The amount of food that occupied the skillet did not fill in this tiny area. It basically was one tiny, thin square piece of polenta topped with bits of mushroom and spinach with a splash of tomato sauce topped with two eggs. The taste was not awful, but I would not crave it again and would not recommend it to anyone. It came with choice of salad (just lettuce sprinkled with olive oil) or home fries. I opted for salad, but my friend chose home fries which amounted to a small pile of whole roasted garlic cloves and about three chunks of potato. The restaurant has a cool vibe.

Of course, because it was already 7:10 (yes, it took them more than an hour), I went to our waiter and told him we were noticing that other people were being served their meals and that we were actually the second table to arrive in the restaurant. He immediately became beligerant with me, saying that we had not told him to fire up our table an that our meals were being prepared now (7:12). I was very irritated with him, not expecting to be told off that way after inquiring about our late dinner. I went back to the table and told folks that our meals had not been yet prepared.

Unfortunately, the owner had to intervene and said she wanted to comp the entire thing, and that is exactly what we did not want to do. All four of us, offered multiple times to pay.

There were three appetizer selections and the one hot appetizer was out before the two cold dishes so that the warm dish was cold by the time everyone was served. For the entrees, half the party was served several minutes later than the rest of the party. I understand it's a big party, but you shouldn't book that big of a party if you can't accomodate it.

The trout also came with a good amount of salad, which was perfect for me. We also had the molten chocolate with the marshmallows. Also very good but a bit too sweet for my taste. Without wine, the average cost was about $30 per person. The four of us shared the chocolate dessert and it was plenty.

So lucky for me, there was the Sarah Janes Griddle Flight (or something like that) and it included \"sampler\" sizes of 1 buttermilk pancake, 1 gingerbread pancake, and 1 french toast! From the first to last bite, it was just a journey of yummy-ness. I think the buttermilk pancake was probably one of the best I've ever had. The gingerbread one was my least favorite but it was still good. I picked the french toast tahiti and I liked it a lot, but I wouldn't suggest it unless you really like bananas because they load that shit on. My friend got like the lox bagel and the dungeness crab benedict I believe. I only took a bite out of the benedict but it was enough for me to say that it was really good. Better than squat and gobbles, they actually used fresh crab meat here.. Anyways, our main dishes were incredible, but the shining star was the housemade cream cheese coffee cake! Every bite was perfection. It was warm and moist and the cream cheese just topped it off! The portion was huge too! I mean it was $7 but I guess we paid what it's worth.

Nice cozy place with no frills but good quality food and lots of character. I know I was punished by Gods because I decided to go there on Valentine's day. I called one week in advance for reservation after I saw their web site info: dinner for 2 for $75. So I thought why not? reasonable price, good French food, sounds great. The actual experience was a disaster. I should have turned away when I got there: no usual chef in sight, gone are the charming french waitresses, the whole place rearranged to pack as many couples as possible. The open kitchen was manned by several Hispanic guys, waiters (all male) looked like they were from eastern Europe and definitely not France. The set menu had no mention of price. Later it turned out to be $60 per person and not $75 per couple one week ago (when I checked the web site during the dinner, it was changed appropriately, so my bad). Now to the point which is food. I got 6 tiny fishy oysters for appetizer with some overpowering onion/vinegar mix (which you need to get rid of oyster smell), my date got green asparagus in some salty grease, main dish was filet mignon in some heavy sauce (and sea bass with some cloying sweet sauce) and finally I got so called profiteroles, which were cream puffs from frozen section in the supermarket (not even thawed, with icy hard filling). Overall, the food felt cheap and muddy, nothing remotely close to my previous experiences at the restaurant. Now, I am not sure what happened here, the place was sold or just rented out for the night to the people that usually do dishes there. Regardless of the reason, it was a cheat, and I will not return there again.

We sought out this place seeing that it had 4-stars on Yelp. I usually don't heed the reviews here and this place made me understand that it is for a good reason. We almost turned around and walked out the door when we saw the soup-kitchen decor. I wish we had. We ordered a salad that was way over dressed and soggy. Then we ordered roast chicken that was dreadful unless you like a dry, flavorless meal. The only reprieve was a decent Potato leek soup, but that is easy to make. I went home and cooked a roast chicken the next day that was 100x better. There's a test - If I can cook better than a restaurant, there is a problem. Not sure what the lure is here, but it certainly isn't ambiance or food. I understand restaurants, like everyone, have bad days.

We walk in and the host guy remembers me from other places I've been to eat around the city, so that was cool. And then my friend Robin recognizes a server she used to work with. And I see a line cook I knew from presidio social club. It's cool to see how us industry peeps come across everyone we've met at some point or another. Anyways we sat down and I ordered a glass of wine and my friend wanted to taste two different wines. The waitress brings my glass and then it takes her 15 min to get my friends first taster. She didn't like it and asked for the other. The waitress then takes another 15 minutes just for that!!! So she has been sitting there with no drink for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the other tables around us were given their drinks in a timely manner. Finallyy she got her glass. Moving on...we ordered so much food! Being chefs/cooks ourselves, we are always curious and want to try as much as we can. I really hate the fact that we paid $17 for two pieces of sweetbreads about the size of a half dollar. Really?? Who are you trying to fool? Not us, cause that didn't work. Let's move on again, escargot tasted like straight grassy parsley. Not great. The chicken liver mousse was disappointing...if people order mousse, they obviously like the Taste of that particular organ so why try to lighten it up soooo much and put it in a canister and whip it?? It tasted like nothing. It was like airy, fluffy butter. No real liver flavor. And all this time out waitress has not come over once to check on us but mind you she has checked in to all the tables around us several times. Has to ask a food runner for bread. And my friend finished her drink and since we couldn't find the damn waitress she asked the bus boy if she could order a drink (obviously that wasn't gonna happen but we were getting desperate). He had to go pull her out from around the corner and we got another drink. There's so much more food we had but it would make this review even longer and it not worth it since nothing was amazing, just good. After we were done with our 10 courses, yes TEN!!, the waitress finally comes to is to ask about dessert. We order and eat it and get the bill. Paid and left the most crappiest tip I have ever left in my life with a nice hand written note at the bottom of it. I honestly believe that's what she deserved because I have been every where in the city and that lady just sucked. And kind of put a downer on our experience. U have friends at Benu who recommended this place to me and I let them know afterwards of our experience and he was even shocked. whatever.

We also split an order of Frittes-which we thought would come out with the mussels but didn't-at least that is what we asked of our waiter. They arrived first and it was at least 30 minutes before any other food came out. My fianc wanted to try the chicken wings-gross, ugh I could barely eat one.  They were overcooked and had basically green mayo dip served with them. Then arrived the mussels after almost an hour and then the roasted chicken quite a bit after that. The roasted chicken was ok.

He didn't accept my suggestion very openly and told me that this is not a cheap restaurant, and that what I ate was an expensive french truffle, & that i shouldn't walk into his restaurant thinking everything is free.

I went to Einstein's on Sunday morning 9/22/13 to grab a quick bagel before I went about my morning. The woman took my order and input it into the computer. I went to the next register to pay and POLO rang me up and took my money. I saw my order come on the little screen in front and when he asked if I wanted a receipt I declined because I had been there a thousand times and never had any issues to where I needed one. So I sat and waited, and waited, and WAITED. 25 minutes go by and I went up to the front to inquire about my bagels and the short woman with blonde hair, who looked completely STONED, just gave me a puzzled look, checked the order screen from which they work, then said she would make it now. I had somewhere to be in 5 minutes so I said I wanted my money back instead because I no longer had time to wait for 2 bagels, which should only take about 2 min to begin with. I went to the cash register so they could refund me and WIL asked for my receipt to which I said i didn't have one. He asked POLO if he remembered charging me and he said \"I don't know. I think so.\" At this point WIL was giving us attitude and he had to go into the back to print out documentation of my order before he could refund us. I finally got my money back but it was such an ordeal. These were some of the most SLOPPY employees I had ever seen. Between the petite blonde girl who looked stoned, WIL the assistant manager who was giving us attitude, and an entire team that somehow \"Lost\" my order, it is safe to say that I will be boycotting this location and most likely the Einstein's bagel corporation. This was the WORST bagel experience ever. I am going to take my business elsewhere. I will drive completely out of the way to go to Bruegger's Bagels from now on since they are superior in all aspects.
