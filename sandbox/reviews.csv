                    ",4.0,,2,"We wanted to try one of the many Italian places in the area. To be honest our first choice was booked. But after our meal we were kind of glad about that. We didn't have a great start. We had a 9:00 reservation arrived a few minutes early and the host said it would be ten minutes, fine no problem. He didn't suggest we get a drink at the bar. And if we had there was really nowhere to stand with them since there are tables surrounding the bar area. Twenty minutes later I had to go ask the host for an update to which he said they were just waiting for people to pay and get up but they can't make them leave. Um, ok. All I needed to know was if it was going to be five more minutes or ten more. I was a little annoyed by this, having been a hostess I think you should give people updates not make them come to you especially when they had a reservation time. On another note the host stand is set up terribly so both hostesses had their backs turned to me and were on the phone when I arrived, they never even saw me, the third host is the one that approached. But that is bad design. Back to the food. After being sat we ordered cocktails, the silverlake lumberjack was the table favorite. We ordered some salads to share, the escarole gained a new fan from a notoriously picky eater. Our entrees, thankful for an actual entree not small plates, arrived pretty quick considering we didn't order them until we finished the salads. Honestly everyone tried a bite if everyones dish and it was all amazing. Mine seemed to be the winner though, the bigoli which actually ends up being very ramen inspired which I love but if you don't it would be a weird experience. The mushroom risotto tasted so good, and I am a new convert to mushrooms. And of course the short rib raviolis were a favorite. Desserts were good, though I think my brother might make a better tiramisu. If I lived in LA I'd go back but as an infrequent visitor I'd probably try one of the many other Italian inspired places if I were to be in the area again. But I highly recommend giving it a try, maybe get a drink before so the wait for a reservation isn't quite so annoying.",4.0,956.0,"

Then we had a special Idaho thin potato pieces pizza along with 2 pasta dishes: Vongole Spaghetti (clams with white wine), and Bella Roma (mussels, clams, shrimps, mushrooms with marinara). BOMB! Totally in love with the food. At last we ended with a cup of Cappuccino and a Godiva Chocolate Lava Cake, drooled for the entire night.

Every time I take a bite of their veggie quesadilla is like I'm trying it for the first time. Finally a quesadilla that's more interesting than just some tortillas poorly glued together with cheese. I'm not sure how they do it but their veggie quesadilla would totally make my meat eating friends jealous and that's very hard to do. The fries are soaked in oil but if you are going to eat fries you better do it the right way and yes they are delicious. The pasta's are great although I don't crave them as much as I crave their grilled menu. My favorite has to be the bbq salad. I'm not big on salads because I'm just not into most dressings.
